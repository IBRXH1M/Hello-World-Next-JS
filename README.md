# Fancy Hello World with Next.js

Welcome to the "Fancy Hello World" project! This is a creative and interactive demonstration of a simple "Hello World" text using Next.js. It features glowing text effects, smooth animations, and hover interactions.

## Project Overview

This project showcases a single-page application built with Next.js that displays a stylized "Hello World" message. The design includes:
- A glowing text effect
- Dynamic background animation
- Hover effects with text transformation

## Features

- **Glowing Text**: The "Hello World" text has a glowing effect for an eye-catching appearance.
- **Background Animation**: A smooth radial gradient animation provides a dynamic background.
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive hover effects that scale and rotate the text, enhancing user interaction.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18.x or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fancy-hello-world.git
   cd fancy-hello-world
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Run the following command to install the required npm packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**

   Start the development server with:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Project Structure

- `pages/index.js`: The main file for the "Hello World" component and styling.
- `styles/globals.css`: Contains global CSS animations and hover effects.

### How It Works

1. **Component Setup**

   The `Home` component in `pages/index.js` uses inline styles for dynamic effects. The `use client` directive ensures that the component is rendered on the client side to support React hooks like `useRef`.

2. **Styling**

   - **Glowing Text**: Achieved using CSS `textShadow` property for a luminous effect.
   - **Background Animation**: Implemented using a radial gradient and keyframe animations.
   - **Hover Effects**: Added CSS transitions and transforms for interactive text behavior.

3. **Deploying the Application**

   For deploying the application, consider using Vercel or Netlify for easy deployment of Next.js applications. Here’s a quick guide for Vercel:

   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   vercel
   ```

   Follow the prompts to deploy your application.
